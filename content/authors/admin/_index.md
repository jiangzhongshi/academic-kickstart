I am a fifth-year PhD candidate at the _Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences_, New York University, working on geometry processing with [Prof. Daniele Panozzo](http://cs.nyu.edu/~panozzo). My current research aims to robustly and efficiently process geometric entities with optimization and data driven approaches. My research has been recognized by [Adobe Research Fellowship 2018](https://research.adobe.com/fellowship/previous-fellowship-award-winners/), [Geometry Processing Dataset Award 2019](https://sgp2019.di.unimi.it/awards/SGP2019_dataset_award_scroll.pdf),
and [Jacob T. Schwartz PhD Fellowship 2020](https://cims.nyu.edu/academics/student_recognition.html).

<!-- From 2017-2018, I am fortunate to work with [Vladimir G. Kim](http://vovakim.com) at the Creative Intelligence Lab, [Adobe Research](//research.adobe.com). -->

I earned my Bachelor of Science in _Mathematics and Applied Mathematics_ from the School of Gifted Young, [University of Science and Technology of China](//www.ustc.edu.cn) in 2016.
