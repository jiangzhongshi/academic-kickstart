# Biography

I am a second-year PhD student at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, working on computer graphics and geometry processing with [Prof. Daniele Panozzo](http://cs.nyu.edu/~panozzo), in [Geometric Computing Lab](http://cims.nyu.edu/gcl/index.html). My current research aims to robustly and efficiently solve geometric creation problems with optimization and data driven approaches.

From 2017-2018, I am fortunate to work with [Vladimir G. Kim](//vovakim.com), [M. Ersin Yumer](//meyumer.com) and Stefano Corazza at the Creative Intelligence Lab, [Adobe Research](//research.adobe.com).

I earned my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the School of Gifted Young, [University of Science and Technology of China](//www.ustc.edu.cn) in 2016, where I worked with Prof. Ligang Liu.
