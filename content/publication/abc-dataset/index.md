  We introduce ABC-Dataset, a collection of one million Computer-Aided Design
  (CAD) models for research of geometric deep learning methods and applications.
  Each model is a collection of explicitly parametrized curves and surfaces,
  providing ground truth for differential quantities, patch segmentation,
  geometric feature detection, and shape reconstruction. Sampling the parametric
  descriptions of surfaces and curves allows generating data in different
  formats and resolutions, enabling fair comparisons for a wide range of
  geometric learning algorithms. As a use case for our dataset, we perform a
  large-scale benchmark for estimation of surface normals, comparing existing
  data driven methods and evaluating their performance against both the ground
  truth and traditional normal estimation methods.
