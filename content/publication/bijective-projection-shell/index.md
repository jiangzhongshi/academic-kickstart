# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "We introduce an algorithm to convert a self-intersection free, orientable, and manifold triangle mesh T into a generalized prismatic shell equipped with a bijective projection operator to map T to a class of discrete surface contained within the shell whose normals satisfy a simple local condition. Properties can be robustly and efficiently transferred between these surfaces using the prismatic layer as a common parametrization domain. The combination of the prismatic shell construction and corresponding projection operator is a robust building block readily usable in many downstream applications, including the solution of PDEs, displacement maps synthesis, Boolean operations, tetrahedral meshing, geometric textures, and nested cages."
abstract_short = "Adjusting the common used orthogonal projection between discrete surfaces a reliable tool, by constructing a shell to restrict the domain."
